# Project Background 
This project analyzes a yearâ€™s worth of sales from a fictitious pizza restaurant, capturing the date and time of each order along with details on the pizzas served, including type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients. The goal is to assess sales performance and customer preferences by examining key metrics like product popularity, ingredient demand, peak sales times, and order patterns across categories and sizes. Through the creation of interactive dashboards, this analysis aims to deliver actionable insights to help refine sales strategies, streamline operations, and elevate the dining experience at the pizza restaurant.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas : 

- **Pizza Performance**: Analyzing top- and low-performing pizzas to identify bestsellers and underperformers.
- **Category and Size Preferences**: Comparing sales across non-vegetarian and vegetarian options, order volumes by category, and customer preferences for different pizza sizes.
- **Ingredient Popularity**: Examining ingredient sales to highlight the most popular and high-revenue ingredients.
- **Peak Sales Times**: Conducting time-based analysis to pinpoint peak sales periods, including peak times of day, specific hours, and high-traffic days.
- **Monthly Performance**: Analyzing sales trends across months to identify the highest-performing period

# Recommendations

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided : 

- Store credit or points can be applied as discounts when purchasing pizzas. Additionally, by occasionally multiplying these points on random days, sales may experience an uplift.
- To enhance Sunday revenue, think about reducing working hours to support employee well-being while also driving pizza sales through limited-time B1G1 flash sales.
- Let customers design custom pizzas with up to 5 toppings. The best ones chosen by the top chef can be added to the menu, and the customer who created it can name the pizza, allowing for regular menu updates based on customer choices.
- October has the lowest revenue, likely due to its seasonal nature, with Halloween as a key factor. To leverage this, think about introducing Halloween-themed pizzas for the whole month or the week leading up to the event. If successful, this approach could extend to incorporating themed pizzas for other festivals too.
- At the close of the year, gather feedback from customers to identify areas for improvement in the restaurant.
- Due to the lower demand for XL and XXL-sized pizzas, consider introducing a half-and-half pizza option, allowing customers to enjoy two different pizza varieties on a single pie.
